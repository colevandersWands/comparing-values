learning objectives:
* comparisons are functions.  f: (type, type) -> 'boolean'
* comparisons force an order on sets
* strict equality & !equality compares type & value
* implicit coercion makes it seems like JS is comparing between types, but it isn't behind the scenes
* loose equality & !equality coerces behind the scenes according to clear rules, then does a 'strict comparison'
* inequalities also do implicit coercion
* inequalities place an order on all elements in each type
